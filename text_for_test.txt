The plastic world has won
A mock-up turned out to be the stronger? one,
The last little ship has cooled down!
The last little lantern has tired123
 
And clods of memory wheeze in the throat
 
Oh-oh, my defence
A reflected light of a glass eye
A funereal ball of the ridiculous world
A funereal ball of the cheap world
 
The plastic world has won
A cardboard alarm bell triumphs
Who needs a slice of July sky?
 
Oh-oh, my defence
A reflected light of a sightless world
Oh-oh, my defence
A funereal ball of a glass eye
A funereal light of the ridiculous world
 
The plastic world has won
A mock-up turned out to be the stronger one
The last little ship has cooled down
The last little lantern has tired
 
And clods of memory wheeze in the throat
 
Oh-oh, my defence
A funereal ball of a sightless world
Oh-oh, my defence
A reflected light of a glass eye
